🧠 **Missionaries and Cannibals Game – Python Implementation**

This project is a classic implementation of the Missionaries and Cannibals problem using basic Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions. It’s a great beginner-level logic game that demonstrates state-space search, problem-solving, and safe-state transition logic.

🎮**Game Description**

Three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river using a boat that can carry up to two people. The challenge is to ensure that cannibals never outnumber missionaries on either side of the river at any time. The player must choose the correct combinations of missionaries and cannibals to move across the river safely.

💡 **Key Features**

Step-by-step moves with input validation

Victory and failure conditions handled

Teaches decision-making and problem constraints

🛠️ **Concepts Used**

Flow control (if, while)

Functions and loops

Lists and state tracking

Problem-solving logic
